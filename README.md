# MachineLearningStats
Machine Learning &amp; Statistics Module Sept 2019


See Jupyter Notebook at BostonHousePricesAnalysis.ipynb


Project Instructions:
This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices [1] dataset and the Python [3] packages 
scipy [2], keras [7], and jupyter [6]. The project is worth 100% of your marks for this module, but 
it is broken into three parts, as follows.

(20%) Describe: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The 
repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within the repository, create a 
jupyter [6] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices 
[1] dataset. This part is worth 20% of your overall mark.

(20%) Infer: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential statistics to 
analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are 
along the Charles river and those that aren’t. You should explain and discuss your findings within 
the notebook. This part is also worth 20%.

(60%) Predict: Again using the same notebook, use keras [7] to create a neural network that can 
predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. You are free to interpret 
this as you wish — for example, you may use all the other variables, or select a subset. 
This part is worth 60%.
